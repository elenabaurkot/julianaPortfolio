          <!-- Educational Philosophy Statement -->
          <p>
            As the decisive element in the classroom,  I want to help my students develop a growth mindset and understand that they are capable of achieving anything. We will not always know what their lives are like at home. We cannot control the outside world for all of our students, but we have a huge responsibility to make sure that they feel safe, loved and understood inside the walls of our classroom in order to promote an environment in which they can learn. That being said, I believe that the elements that are most conducive to learning are differentiation, withitness, and enthusiasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a student teacher in Bound Brook, New Jersey,  in both an ABA kindergarten/first grade classroom and a kindergarten inclusion classroom. From this experience, I realized the importance of accommodating individuals and differentiating instruction to reach all the students in the classroom. I demonstrated this through creating specific learning goals for students, accommodating individuals in my lessons, and working with my cooperating teachers to discuss the adjustments that should be made to assignments and lessons. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The next element is “withitness”. This is a term that was coined by Jacob Kounin and describes a teacher’s awareness of what is going on in all parts of the classroom at any given time. I believe this to be my biggest learning curve in the classroom. It was tricky for me to keep my eyes on all students, however, being conscious of the need for improvement when teaching lessons I tried to be mindful of scanning the room regularly during lessons, and walking throughout the classroom while students were working. This is an element that I want to continue to work on throughout my teaching career. 
          </p>
          <p>
            While these elements can be learned and worked on, I think that something all teachers can bring to the classroom everyday is enthusiasm. Enthusiasm can be shown in many ways in the classroom. First, I believe teachers need to show enthusiasm in the lives of their students. As a student teacher, I was eager to explore the interests and backgrounds of my students. My favorite feeling as a teacher was watching the excitement in the students’ eyes as I incorporated their names and favorite animals or hobbies into my lessons. Next, I wanted to show enthusiasm in the way I cared about their lives outside of school. I tried to actively communicate with the family members of the students through letters I sent out in the languages that were representative of the classroom. Through this I established a level of comfort with the families and was able to express how special each of their students were to the classroom during parent teacher conferences. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that these three elements are a fairly well rounded start to approaching a classroom full of students who have a capacity to achieve many things when we instill that belief in them. As a teacher, I want to make sure that I am giving students the room to explore their interests through our lessons and building a growth mindset in the learners. I will be constantly reflecting on my teaching, as I understand that there is no such thing as a perfect teacher. It will take constant reflection to make sure that I am providing different learners with opportunities to succeed. My main goal is to be understanding and flexible in my classroom, so the students know that I will shapeshift when they need something that will be more conducive to their learning and allow them to grow as humans and learners.
